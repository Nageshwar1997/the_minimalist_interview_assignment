        Our products are crafted exclusively from the dreams and screams of
        young kids who wanted to show their mastery in their chosen fields, but
        were directed towards a factory for daily wages. Each cracker bursts
        brighter than their lost smiles, and can be heard louder than their
        cries for miles. Buy them, burst them, brag about them.
